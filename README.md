Hello! My name is Quinn Meiszinger and this site serves to document my experiences and progress as a Computer Science student. I am currently enrolled at the University of Guelph in the Computer Science Co-op program. I will be documenting each semester as well as reporting on each work term I complete. As time progresses, I hope to share my growth and development in the realm of Computer Science.
